                <hr>
                <p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Droplet transmission is an easy method in which this virus is transferred to another host when the infected host is within a meter from another person. This can be from sneezing or coughing which can be exposed to the unaffected person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, possibly affecting them. Evidence shows the possibility of COVID-19 causing intestinal infection and then being transmitted via feces. However, no evidence of it has been recorded as of March 27, 2020. The infected can be grouped into four major categories, that of “sub-clinical” that do not display symptoms but have the virus. This is the least serious of all of the categories. These people can still pass on the virus, along with the others infected that are grouped in all of the other major categories. Then, there are those with upper respiratory tract infections which exert fever, cough, and possible symptoms of pinkeye and headache. The majority of people gain flu-like symptoms. However, the most serious conditions will see severe illnesses, especially pneumonia. Those with high blood pressure, diabetes, lung problems, and those that are elderly are more likely to develop severe illnesses once they contract COVID-19. Pneumonia is caused when the lining of the respiratory tree is damaged. This will lead to inflammation which irritates the nerves lining the airway. Then, the gas exchange units will be affected which leads to them pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs. If the air sacs get inflamed, inflammatory material will be outpoured into the lungs. Then, these materials will fill the lungs and make it harder for them to take in enough oxygen and remove enough carbon dioxide. This leads to pneumonia. This pneumonia has evidence of being severe and affecting the entire lung.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The virus was a product of natural evolution and emerged at first in the city of Wuhan in China in late 2019. This virus was evolved to target the molecular feature on the outside of human ACE2 cells and did this very efficiently, further supporting the claim that this was not engineered by humans. This virus resembled coronaviruses found in pangolins and bats. It could possibly have come about by the virus evolving in non-human hosts to be able to target human cells via natural selection. Then a possible intermediate host could have helped to facilitate the virus to infect a human. The other possible way that the virus could have come to affect humans is by being transferred by an intermediary while still being in its non-pathogenic version before then evolving to its pathogenic version while in the human population.

                <p>By supporting social distancing and other procedures to decrease the rate of transmission, numerous countries hope to flatten the curve such that the virus will not grow as exponentially as it possibly could. This will make it more possible to treat patients without overwhelming a country’s healthcare system.

                <p>The best thing during this situation is not to panic. However, precautions should be taken. The world has successfully gone through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which are both coronaviruses. The SARS outbreak had its first case in 2002. SARS-CoV had a 15% mortality rate and a total of 8,098 cases. The MERS outbreak was first identified in a patient in 2012. MERS-CoV had a total of 2,494 infected cases with a case-fatality rate of 34.4%. There is a current 18% death rate for the COVID-19 with a current 668,368 both infected and recovered as of March 29, 2020.
